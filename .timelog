Sunday the 12th of October
Quite a few hours!
I'd say like 5 maybe? Got the code engine mostly done + some of the assets in so that's a win
Now I jsut need content
Spent a good hour on a good s-curve implementation that really shouldn't count lol

Monday, tuesday - spent maybe an hour each of these reading articles
Wednesday - two, three solid hours post-lunch analyzing articles and writing code
